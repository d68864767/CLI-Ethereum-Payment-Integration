# User Manual

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the CLI Ethereum Payment Integration application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine.
- An Ethereum wallet with at least 1 ETH for making payments.
- The CLI Ethereum Payment Integration application installed and set up on your machine. If not, please refer to the `deployment_instructions.md` file.

## Using the Application

The application provides three main commands: `pay`, `verify`, and `track`.

### Pay Command

The `pay` command is used to request a payment of 1 ETH. 

To use the `pay` command, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is installed.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python cli_app.py pay --address YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS
```

Replace `YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS` with your actual Ethereum address. 

The application will then provide an Ethereum address to which you should send 1 ETH.

### Verify Command

The `verify` command is used to verify a payment.

To use the `verify` command, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is installed.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python cli_app.py verify --transaction YOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH
```

Replace `YOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH` with the actual transaction hash of your payment. 

The application will then verify the payment and provide feedback.

### Track Command

The `track` command is used to track the status of a transaction.

To use the `track` command, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is installed.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python cli_app.py track --transaction YOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH
```

Replace `YOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH` with the actual transaction hash of your payment. 

The application will then provide the status of the transaction.

## Security Measures
