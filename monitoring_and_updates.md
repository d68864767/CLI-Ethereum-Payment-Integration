# Monitoring and Updates

This document outlines the process for monitoring the CLI Ethereum Payment Integration application and making necessary updates.

## Monitoring

The application uses the `loguru` library for logging. This library provides a simple and flexible way to log events and track the application's behavior. 

The logs are stored in a file named `app.log`, which is created in the same directory as the application. The log file includes information about payment requests, payment verifications, transaction tracking, and any errors that occur during these processes.

To monitor the application, regularly check the `app.log` file and look for any unusual or unexpected entries. In particular, pay attention to error messages, which indicate that something went wrong.

Here are some things to look for:

- Errors in payment requests or verifications: These could indicate a problem with the Ethereum Wallet API or the user's Ethereum address.
- Failed transactions: If a transaction fails, it could mean that the user didn't have enough ETH in their account, or there was a problem with the Ethereum network.
- Security warnings or errors: These could indicate attempted unauthorized access or other security issues.

## Updates

The application is designed to be easily updated. Here's a general process for making updates:

1. Identify the issue or improvement: This could come from user feedback, monitoring the logs, or your own observations.
2. Update the code: Make the necessary changes in the relevant Python file(s). Be sure to follow good coding practices and thoroughly test your changes.
3. Update the tests: If you made changes that affect the application's behavior, update `test_payment_system.py` to reflect these changes. Run the tests to ensure everything still works as expected.
4. Document the changes: Update this document and any other relevant documentation to reflect the changes you made.
5. Deploy the update: Follow the deployment instructions to deploy the updated application.

Remember, the goal is to continuously improve the application and fix any issues that arise. Regular monitoring and updates are key to achieving this goal.
